## Introduction to Sulphite AI

Sulphite AI is one of its kind — an AI built to revolutionize the local AI market and education landscape in Pakistan.  
The goal of this product is to make a giant leap in the AI industry, and I truly believe it will change how we use AI in daily life and learning.

## Why Sulphite AI?

What makes Sulphite AI special? Why should students, parents, and educators trust it?

The answer lies in the meaning of the word **"Sulphite."**

Gellet Burgess, an American humorist, split humans into two groups:

- **Bromides** — dull, following traditions blindly, panicking at small things, blaming others.  
- **Sulphites** — original, energetic, unconventional thinkers who do ordinary things in extraordinary ways.

Chemically, Bromides are dull, while Sulphur and Sulphites symbolize fire and energy.  
A Sulphite might swim out to save someone while still smoking his pipe — bold and unorthodox.

Choosing Sulphite AI means choosing originality, boldness, and breaking free from the ordinary.  
_To see Sulphite is to become Sulphite, and to become Sulphite is to leave behind dullness._
